/**
 * Abstract class SafeBaseContract serves as a base for creating a Safe contract for a specific adapter (Ethers.js, Web3.js, or viem.js)
 * This class is designed to be extended by adapter-specific abstract classes, such as SafeBaseContractEthers, SafeBaseContractWeb3, and SafeBaseContractViem.
 * It includes the core logic for selecting the appropriate ABI and the address from Safe deployments and determining the correct L1 or L2 contract version of the Safe.
 *
 * @template SafeContractAbiType - The ABI associated with the Safe contract.
 *
 * Example subclasses extending this base class:
 * - SafeBaseContractEthers<SafeContract_v1_3_0_Abi> extends SafeBaseContract<SafeContract_v1_3_0_Abi>
 * - SafeBaseContractWeb3<SafeContract_v1_3_0_Abi> extends SafeBaseContract<SafeContract_v1_3_0_Abi>
 * - SafeBaseContractViem<SafeContract_v1_3_0_Abi> extends SafeBaseContract<SafeContract_v1_3_0_Abi>
