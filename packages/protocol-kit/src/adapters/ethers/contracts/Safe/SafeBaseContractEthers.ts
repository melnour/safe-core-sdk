/**
 * Abstract class SafeBaseContractEthers extends SafeBaseContract to specifically integrate with the Ethers.js v6 library.
 * It is designed to be instantiated for different versions of the Safe contract.
 *
 * This abstract class sets up the Ethers v6 Contract object that interacts with a Safe contract version.
 *
 * Subclasses of SafeBaseContractEthers are expected to represent specific versions of the Safe contract.
 *
 * @template SafeContractAbiType - The ABI type specific to the version of the Safe contract, extending InterfaceAbi from Ethers.
 * @extends SafeBaseContract<SafeContractAbiType> - Extends the generic SafeBaseContract with Ethers-specific implementation.
 *
 * Example subclasses:
 * - SafeContract_v1_4_1_Ethers extends SafeBaseContractEthers<SafeContract_v1_4_1_Abi>
 * - SafeContract_v1_3_0_Ethers extends SafeBaseContractEthers<SafeContract_v1_3_0_Abi>
 * - SafeContract_v1_2_0_Ethers extends SafeBaseContractEthers<SafeContract_v1_2_0_Abi>
 * - SafeContract_v1_1_1_Ethers extends SafeBaseContractEthers<SafeContract_v1_1_1_Abi>
 * - SafeContract_v1_0_0_Ethers extends SafeBaseContractEthers<SafeContract_v1_0_0_Abi>
